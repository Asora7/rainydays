He started making jackets for when its raining. He soon got attention for his jackets and people began to offer money to buy is jackets. He made them all by hand and by quality. All this turned into what Rainydays is today. We are a large company that provides jackets made perfectly for keeping you dry and warm. Especially made for the Northern cold weather.
